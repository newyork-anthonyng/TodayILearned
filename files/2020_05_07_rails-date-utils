Dates are usually a pain to work with. Rails and ruby has a large amount of date utilities.

It can tell you if a day is Friday.
```ruby
my_date.friday? # false
```

It can get you the last day of the month.
```ruby
# Rails
# https://apidock.com/rails/DateAndTime/Calculations/end_of_month

my_date.end_of_month
```
